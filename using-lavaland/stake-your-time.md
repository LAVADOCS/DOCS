# Stake your TIME (🎩, 🎩)

Staking allows you to earn **TIME** passively via auto-compounding. By staking your **TIME** with **Wonderland**, you receive **MEMOries** (staked TIME) in return at a 1:1 ratio. After that, your MEMOries balance will increase automatically on every epoch (8 hours) based on the current APY.

The **MEMOries** address on Avalanche is **0x136Acd46C134E8269052c62A67042D6bDeDde3C9.**

* **APY** tells you the annualized rate of return based on the reward yield. It takes into account the effect of compounding since **MEMOries** rebases exponentially.
* **TVL** measures the dollar amount of all the staked **TIME** in Wonderland.
* **Current Index** allows you to track your gain from staking. The index started from 1 at epoch 0, and increases every epoch. If you staked at genesis (epoch 0) and never unstaked any **TIME**, your balance today would be X times greater, where X is the current index. You can use the index to track your position by marking down the index number when you stake and unstake. You divide the index number when you unstake by the index number when you stake to get the ratio by which your **MEMOries** balance has increased.
* **Your Balance** tells you how many unstaked **TIME** are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can stake.
* **Your Staked Balance** tells you how many staked **TIME** are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can unstake.
* **Next Reward Amount** tells you how much MEMO you are getting next rebase,
* **Next Reward Yield** tells you how much your **MEMOries** balance will increase when the next epoch begins. For example, if you stake 100 **TIME** and the upcoming rebase is 0.5427%, your **MEMOries** balance would increase from 100 to 100.5427.
* **ROI (5-Day Rate)** estimates how much your **MEMOries** balance will increase after 5 days, if the reward yield stays the same during this period. For example, if you stake 100 **TIME** and the rate is 8.4577%, your **MEMOries** balance would increase from 100 to 108.4577 after 5 days.
