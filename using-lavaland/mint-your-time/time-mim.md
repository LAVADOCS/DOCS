1\. Make sure you have **LAVA-DAI LP** tokens in your wallet. You need to go to **TraderJoe** and add liquidity for the **LAVA-DAI LP** pool to acquire them. Find the link to provide liquidity to the pool [**here**](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/pool/0x130966628846BFd36ff31a822705796e8cb8C18D/0xb54f16fB19478766A268F172C9480f8da1a7c9C3). 2. Head to the [**LAVA-DAI Mint**](https://app.lavaland.money/#/mints/mim\_time\_lp) page of the **Lavaland** website. There are two tabs: "Mint" and "Redeem". Make sure "Mint" is selected.

3\. Type in the amount of **LAVA DAI LP** tokens you would like to use in order to mint LAVA. Make sure you are not trying to mint more than is allowed. The Max You Can Buy field below shows the maximum amount of **LAVA** you can purchase.

4\. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the Lavaland contract to spend your **LAVA-DAI LP** tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

‌5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Mint" by now.

‌6. Click "Time" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have minted LAVA using **LAVA-DAI LP** tokens!
