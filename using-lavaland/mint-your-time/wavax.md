1\. Make sure you have **wAVAX** tokens in your wallet. You need to go to **TraderJoe** and wrap your AVAX tokens into wAVAX to acquire them, or use the "USE AVAX" option in the UI to use your native AVAX tokens. 2. Head to the [**wAVAX Mint**](https://app.wonderland.money/#/mints/wavax) **** page of the **Wonderland** website. There are two tabs: "Mint" and "Redeem". Make sure "Mint" is selected.

3\. Type in the amount of **wAVAX** tokens you would like to use in order to mint TIME. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The Max You Can Buy field below shows the maximum amount of **TIME** you can purchase.

4\. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the Wonderland contract to spend your **wAVAX** tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

‌5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Mint" by now.

‌6. Click "Mint" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have minted TIME using **wAVAX** tokens!
