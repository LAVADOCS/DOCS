# DAI

DAI Minting was introduced since [**Lavaland**](https://app.lavaland.money/bonds/mim) Launch. It allows you to trade **DAI** in exchange for discounted **LAVA** on Lavaland.

1.  1\.

    Make sure you have **DAI** in your wallet. For example, you can go to [**Trader Joe**](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/trade?inputCurrency=\&outputCurrency=0x130966628846BFd36ff31a822705796e8cb8C18D) to swap FTM for **DAI** if you don't have any, as the deepest liquidity is there!
2.  2\.

    Head to the [**DAI**](https://app.lavaland.money/#/mints/mim) Mint page of the Lavaland website. There are two tabs: "**Mint**" and "**Redeem**". Make sure "**Mint**" is selected.
3.  3\.

    Type in the amount of DAI you would like to use in order to mint LAVA. Make sure you are not trying to mint more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of **LAVA** you can purchase.
4.  4\.

    If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the **Lavaland** contract to spend your DAI. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5.  5\.

    After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Mint" by now.
6.  6\.

    Click "Mint" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have minted your first **LAVA** using DAI tokens!
