1.  1\.

    Make sure you have **MIM** in your wallet. For example, you can go to [**Trader Joe**](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/trade?inputCurrency=\&outputCurrency=0x130966628846BFd36ff31a822705796e8cb8C18D) to swap AVAX for **MIM** if you don't have any, as the deepest liquidity is there!
2.  2\.

    Head to the [**MIM**](https://app.wonderland.money/#/mints/mim) Mint page of the Wonderland website. There are two tabs: "**Mint**" and "**Redeem**". Make sure "**Mint**" is selected.
3.  3\.

    Type in the amount of MIM you would like to use in order to mint TIME. Make sure you are not trying to mint more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of **TIME** you can purchase.
4.  4\.

    If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the **Wonderland** contract to spend your MIM. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5.  5\.

    After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Mint" by now.
6.  6\.

    Click "Mint" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have minted your first **TIME** using MIM tokens!
