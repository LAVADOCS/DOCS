# Staking

### &#x20;<a href="#what-is-staking" id="what-is-staking"></a>

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Wonderland.** Stakers stake their **TIME** tokens on [**Wonderland Website**](https://app.wonderland.money/stake) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from [**bond sales**](https://wonderland.gitbook.io/wonderland/basics/bonding), and can vary based on the number of TIME staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of **TIME** translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of TIME drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked TIME balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock TIME and receive an equal amount of MEMOries.** Your **MEMOries** balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. **MEMOries** is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn MEMOries and receive an equal amount of TIME tokens.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked **TIME** (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
