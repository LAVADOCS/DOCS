# Node Creation

Node creation is a long, term, permanent value creation strategy.

When users mint, they are permanently delagating their lava to create nodes that generate lifetime rewards.

There will be different tiers of nodes available with different requirments and reward rates. The first tier will be identical in reward rate to the community node pool. The only difference is in greater voting power and more say when it comes to governance decisions and treasury allocations. The other two tiers will vary in the amount of lava required to create a node, but will offer a higher yield proprotional to the amount of lava required for its creation.
