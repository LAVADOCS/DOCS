# Bonding Nodes

### &#x20;<a href="#what-is-minting" id="what-is-minting"></a>

**Bonding is the secondary value accrual strategy of Lavaland.** When users bond LAVA nodes, they are actually selling their assets in order to buy a bond from the protocol. Bonding Actions are a cross between a fixed income product, a futures contract, and an option. The protocol quotes the minter with terms for a trade at a future date. These terms include a predefined amount of Nodes the bonder will recieve and the time when vesting is complete. The bond becomes redeemable as it vests. I.e. in a 5-day term, after 2 days into the term 40% of the rewards can be claimed, if it hasn't fully vested into a node.

**Bonding is an active, short-term strategy.** The price discovery mechanism of the secondary bond market renders mints discounts more or less unpredictable. Therefore minting is considered a more active investment strategy that has to be monitored constantly in order to be more profitable as compared to staking.

**Allowing users to purchases bonds  allows Lava Financial to accumulate its own liquidity.** We call our own liquidity **POL**. More POL ensures there is always locked exit liquidity in our trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders. Since Lava Financial becomes its own market, on top of additional certainty for **LAVA** investors, the protocol accrues more and more revenue from LP rewards bolstering our treasury.

Here at Lava Financial we believe that bonding better describes the action that users are taking, when purchasing LAVA with different assets. If you go to the "Bond" page of the website, you will be able to bond LAVA nodes, effectively selling your assets for discounted **nodes**.&#x20;
