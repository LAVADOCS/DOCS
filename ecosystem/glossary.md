### &#x20;<a href="#reward-yield" id="reward-yield"></a>

Reward yield refers to the actual amount of **TIME** received by each staker on each rebase. The reward yield is a rough target from a policy point of view. It can almost never be maintained precisely due to e.g. fluctuating amounts of **TIME** staked.

### &#x20;<a href="#backing-per-time" id="backing-per-time"></a>

_Backing per TIME_, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing **TIME**.
