**​Lava Financial** is the first decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the **Fantom Network** based on the **LAVA** token. Each **LAVA** token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., DAI, LAVA-FTM LP Tokens etc etc) in the Lavaland treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. **Lavaland** also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting.

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, native on the **FTM** network, in which the behavior of the **LAVA** token! In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that **LAVA** can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

We intend to achieve price flatness for a representative basket of goods without the use of fiat currency, in order to allow the cryptocurrency industry to detach once and for all from the traditional finance world!

There are two main strategies for market participants: [**staking**](https://app.lavaland.money/stake) and minting. Stakers stake their **LAVA** tokens in return for more **LAVA** tokens, while minters provide LP tokens or DAI tokens in exchange for discounted **LAVA** tokens after a fixed vesting period.

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new **LAVA** tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for minters comes from price consistency. Minters commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is given in **LAVA** tokens and thus the minter's profit would depend on **LAVA** price when the minted LAVA matures. Taking this into consideration, minters benefit from a rising or static price for the **LAVA** token!

Lavaland is a fork of [**Olympus**](https://www.olympusdao.finance) \*\*\*\* on the Fantom Network. Our team is mostly anonymous, born from the DeFi Community. We aim at becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and we are actively working towards that goal.

Currently most of the decisions are taken by the core team, but we expect to be able to turn this into a DAO-governed model as soon as possible!
