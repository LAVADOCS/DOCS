1\. Make sure you have **wFTM** tokens in your wallet. You need to go to **TraderJoe** and wrap your FTM tokens into wFTM to acquire them, or use the "USE FTM" option in the UI to use your native FTM tokens. 2. Head to the [**wFTM Mint**](https://app.lavaland.money/#/mints/wavax) **** page of the **Lavaland** website. There are two tabs: "Mint" and "Redeem". Make sure "Mint" is selected.

3\. Type in the amount of **wFTM** tokens you would like to use in order to mint LAVA. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The Max You Can Buy field below shows the maximum amount of **LAVA** you can purchase.

4\. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the Lavaland contract to spend your **wFTM** tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

‌5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Mint" by now.

‌6. Click "Mint" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have minted LAVA using **wFTM** tokens!
